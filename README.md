# Weather Dashbord

## Description
This application allows users to search for a city and retrieve current and future weather conditions for that city. There is a search history feature as well, allowing users to easily view information from previous searches.

## Usage
1. Enter the name of a city in the search bar.
2. Click the search button or press enter.
3. The application will display the current weather conditions for the searched city. 
4. This will include the city name, date, weather icon, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
4. Additionally, a 5-day forecast will be shown, including all of the information listed above.
5. To view weather conditions for a previously searched city, click on the desired city in the search history list.
6. The application will update the display with the current and future weather conditions for the selected city.

## Technologies Used
The weather dashboard was built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve the weather data for the searched cities. The application dynamically updates the user interface to show the relevant weather information based on the user's actions.
